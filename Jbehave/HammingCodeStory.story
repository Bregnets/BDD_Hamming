Narrative:
Find Error in Data Transmission with Hamming code
Given a Message if a error occurs while transmitting
Then The algorithm should correct that error

					 
Scenario:  Error-Correction
Given the message 01010101 
When fliping one of the bits in the message 
Then the resulting message should be what was given (01010101)
